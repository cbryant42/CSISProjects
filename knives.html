		This is the Ontario R.A.T II. This is an amazing pocket knife! At about $25.00 you get an amazing folder with a pretty decent steel and it looks great. I honestly can't say enough about this knife. It opens up super smooth, it's really light and thin so you barely even know it's in your pocket, and the blade shape is great for cutting. That full flat grind really just slices though anything. Also, it's a completely open knife meaning if you get it dirty just blow some air through it and it's good as new. However, if it gets really dirty taking it apart only requires a couple t5 torx screws and you're done! I highly recommend this knife, you can't go wrong at the price point and what you get back in return.
