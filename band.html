			One CD they have released is Californication which was released in 1999. This album has some of my absolute favorite songs The Red Hot Chili Peppers have ever released including Scar Tissue, and Californication. I have listened to this album more times than I can count!

			Another album they have released is called Stadium Arcadium which was released in 2006. This is another one of my favorites of theirs because it actually has the first song of theirs I ever listened to! That song is what sparked my interest in their music, and I have not looked back since.

			The third album I would like to talk about is actually their most recent. It is called The Getaway and it was released this year. It was released in June and I think I have listened to it all the way through at least a couple dozen times. My favorite song on the album is called Dark Necessities.
